Most of the farmers use Urea fertilizer in their farm which contains high
amount of Nitrogen Value (N), sometimes the N amount exceeds the
required amount and affects the crop yield. In such scenarios our mobile
application takes the farmers location and based on that locations
threshold value sends an alert message to farmers. Apart from that, a
farmer can receive daily updates, suggestions (personalized on their NPK
values ), improvements on whatsapp, along with a visual image to
improve farmers user experience.
