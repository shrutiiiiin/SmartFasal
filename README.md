### Alerts for Farmers

Most farmers use Urea fertilizer on their farms, which contains a high amount of Nitrogen (N). Sometimes, the Nitrogen amount exceeds the required level, negatively affecting crop yield. 

In such scenarios, our mobile application takes the farmer's location and, based on the location's threshold values, sends an alert message to the farmers. Apart from that, farmers can receive daily updates, personalized suggestions (based on their NPK values), and improvement tips via WhatsApp, along with a visual image to enhance their user experience.
